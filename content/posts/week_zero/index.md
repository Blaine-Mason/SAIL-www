Welcome to the Salisbury AI Lab(SAIL)!

My name is Blaine Mason, and I have been apart of the SAIL group for around a year now.  I am a student at Salisbury University majoring in Computer Science, Math, and Data Science.  Currently, I am interested in going to graduate school and obtaining a PhD to later become a professor.  Enough about me, let's begin talking about what I have and will be working on this semester.

# The Floating Body

Recently, the head of our group Dr. Anderson published a paper titled [Efficiency of the floating body as a robust measure of dispersion](http://faculty.salisbury.edu/~jtanderson/files/floatingbody.pdf).  Most of this paper is beyond my knowledge, but with the help of Dr. Anderson, I have been able to gain a general understanding of the material.  This weeks post will be my attempt to explain this geometric tool to form a better understanding myself.

## Quantiles

To comprehend the floating body, we must introduce a concept from statistics known as quatiles.  The quantile of a level\\(q \in (0,1)\\) of a set of real numbers is the least value that is above a \\(q\\) fraction of the set. For example, the quantile of level \\(.50\\) is also known as the median since it would be contain only \\(50%\\) of the data.
